## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learnt how to structure my HTML and CSS codes, in order to achieve a clean code.
This really helped me on how to stake-up HTML elements for easy styling

- See below:

```html
<div class="container">
      <div class="qr-card">
        <div class="qr-code"><img src="./images/image-qr-code.png" alt=""></div>
        <h2>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h2>
        <p>Scan the QR code to visit front-end Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
      </div>
    </div>
```
